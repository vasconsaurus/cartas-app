# Cartas App / Cards App

This is just a small project to play around a bit with react. I'm trying to practice a bit of what I'm learning in Kent C Dodds' "Epic React" course.
It's a continuation of this other project: https://github.com/vasconsaurus/cartas

You can click on a card, and it will flip a tarot card meaning for you. It's just a way for you to check your luck ;]
